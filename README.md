# REASON: Rational Empirical Analysis and Scientific Observation Network

A comprehensive computational framework for disease analysis, pathway identification, and treatment recommendation through multi-omics data integration and advanced computational methods.

## Overview

REASON is a sophisticated system that combines bioinformatics, systems biology, molecular modeling, and machine learning to analyze disease mechanisms and recommend potential treatments. The system integrates various types of biomedical data to provide a holistic view of disease processes and identify therapeutic targets.

## Features

- **Multi-omics Data Integration**: Analyze gene expression, proteomics, metabolomics, and clinical data
- **Pathway Analysis**: Identify key biological pathways affected in diseases
- **Molecular Modeling**: Predict protein structures and binding sites for potential drug targets
- **Drug Prediction**: Identify potential therapeutic compounds
- **Treatment Recommendation**: Generate personalized treatment options
- **Systems Biology Simulation**: Model disease mechanisms and treatment effects
- **Visualization Tools**: Generate pathway and network visualizations

## Usage

### Basic Usage

To analyze a disease:

```bash
python run_real_reason.py --disease "Disease Name"
```

### Advanced Options

```bash
python run_real_reason.py --disease "Disease Name" \
                          --config config.json \
                          --data_sources gene_expression proteomics literature \
                          --analysis_level comprehensive \
                          --simulate \
                          --validate
```

### Command-Line Arguments

- `--disease`: Name of the disease to analyze (required)
- `--config`: Path to configuration file
- `--data_sources`: List of data sources to use
- `--analysis_level`: Level of analysis (basic, standard, comprehensive)
- `--simulate`: Run systems biology simulation
- `--treatment`: Treatment ID for simulation
- `--validate`: Validate results against known data
- `--output`: Output directory for results
